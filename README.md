🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors (Stage 1 – Basic)

This is the first stage of my Rock Paper Scissors project.
A very simple version built with HTML & JavaScript, where the game result is displayed using alert boxes.

👉 This marks the starting point of my learning journey before moving to advanced versions like score tracking and autoplay.

✨ Features

🎮 Play Mode – Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

🎲 Random Computer Move – Generated using Math.random().

⚡ Alert Output – Results are shown in a popup alert.

🧩 Simple and minimal – just one HTML file.
