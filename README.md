# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors (Stage 1 – Basic)

This is the first stage of my Rock Paper Scissors project.  
A very simple version built with **HTML & JavaScript**, where the game result is displayed using **alert boxes**.  

👉 This marks the starting point of my learning journey before moving to advanced versions like score tracking and autoplay.

## ✨ Features
- 🎮 **Play Mode** – Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  
- 🎲 **Random Computer Move** – Generated using `Math.random()`.  
- ⚡ **Alert Output** – Results are shown in a popup alert.  
- 🧩 Simple and minimal – just one HTML file.
